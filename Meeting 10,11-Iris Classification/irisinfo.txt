Parameter Tuning 

GridSearchCV to find the optimal number of neighbors and weighting scheme through cross-validation. The final KNN model is built in a pipeline that includes data scaling, and it prints the best accuracy and the corresponding hyperparameters.

Why parameter tuning is important:
Machine learning models often have hyperparameters that control how the model learns. Choosing the right values can significantly improve model performance.
GridSearchCV helps automate this search, making sure you find the optimal settings without manually testing each combination.
